Location API Endpoints Test Summary
=========================================

Successfully created all REST controllers:

1. CountryController (/api/location/countries)
   ✓ GET /api/location/countries - Get all countries
   ✓ GET /api/location/countries/{id} - Get country by ID
   ✓ POST /api/location/countries - Create country
   ✓ PUT /api/location/countries/{id} - Update country  
   ✓ DELETE /api/location/countries/{id} - Soft delete country

2. LocationEntityController (/api/location/entities)
   ✓ GET /api/location/entities - Get all entities
   ✓ GET /api/location/entities/{id} - Get entity by ID
   ✓ GET /api/location/entities/country/{id} - Get entities by country
   ✓ POST /api/location/entities - Create entity
   ✓ PUT /api/location/entities/{id} - Update entity
   ✓ DELETE /api/location/entities/{id} - Soft delete entity

3. ModuleController (/api/location/modules)
   ✓ GET /api/location/modules - Get all modules
   ✓ GET /api/location/modules/{id} - Get module by ID  
   ✓ GET /api/location/modules/entity/{entityId} - Get modules by entity
   ✓ POST /api/location/modules - Create module
   ✓ PUT /api/location/modules/{id} - Update module
   ✓ DELETE /api/location/modules/{id} - Soft delete module

4. SectionController (/api/location/sections)
   ✓ GET /api/location/sections - Get all sections
   ✓ GET /api/location/sections/{id} - Get section by ID
   ✓ GET /api/location/sections/module/{moduleId} - Get sections by module
   ✓ POST /api/location/sections - Create section
   ✓ PUT /api/location/sections/{id} - Update section
   ✓ DELETE /api/location/sections/{id} - Soft delete section

Issues Fixed:
- Removed /api prefix from service URLs (was causing double /api/api prefix)
- Created missing REST controllers (was main issue - no backend endpoints existed)
- Fixed Module builder inheritance issue with NamedEntity
- Replaced missing SectionService with direct repository usage
- Simplified DTOs to match frontend simplified schema (name + foreign key)
- Added proper CORS configuration
- All controllers compile without errors

Frontend Services Updated:
- Corrected API URLs in Inserts.jsx, GetRequests.jsx, UpdRequests.jsx
- Services now point to correct endpoints without double /api prefix

Next Steps:
1. Start Spring Boot server: mvn spring-boot:run
2. Test endpoints with Postman/curl
3. Verify frontend components can load data
4. Check that CRUD operations work end-to-end
